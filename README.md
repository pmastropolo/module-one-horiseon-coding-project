# Horiseon-code-refractor-project

## Description

I looked into HTML & CSS forms on website and refactored the code to make the website more accessible. I decided to simplfy the code in HTML to a more element stance. By doing this, I believe it'll be easier for the computer to reconginze your site, therefore creating more attention and foot traffic towards your marketing agency. I also refactored the code in CSS, which will benefit your websites accessibility. My goal is to provide your business better foot traffic thus creating new and happy clients.
