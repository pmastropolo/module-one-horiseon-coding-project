# Horiseon-code-refractor-project

## Description

I looked into HTML & CSS forms on website and refactored the code to make the website more accessible. I decided to simplfy the code in HTML to a more element stance. By doing this, I believe it'll be easier for the computer to reconginze your site, therefore creating more attention and foot traffic towards your marketing agency. I also refactored the code in CSS, which will benefit your websites accessibility. My goal is to provide your business better foot traffic thus creating new and happy clients.

Was provided with Starter Code and a Mock up Image of what website should look like.
